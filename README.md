# Business Goal: 
Predict the evaluation of cars based on their characteristics, thereby providing valuable insights for both consumers and the automobile industry. By exploring various techniques and parameter values, we aim to identify the most effective predictive modeling approach.

# Data Description:

This dataset has 1728 records, each record representing a car evaluation. Each car evaluation is described with 7 attributes. 6 of the attributes represent car characteristics, such as buying price, price of the maintenance, number of doors, capacity in terms of persons to carry, the size of luggage boot, and estimated safety of the car. The seventh variable represents the evaluation of the car (unacceptable, acceptable, good, very good)

# Dependencies

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow 2.0
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

# Solution

Developed a robust model capable of classifying cars as good purchases based on their attributes. Through thorough exploration of different techniques and parameter values, we aim to optimize the model's performance. We will present a concise overview of our predictive modeling process, detailing our explorations and discussing the results obtained.

Upon completion of our exploratory analysis, we will present our final model, which represents the culmination of our efforts to achieve the highest predictive accuracy. We will comprehensively evaluate its performance, considering metrics such as overall accuracy and per-class performance. This evaluation will provide insights into whether our model predicts all classes equally well or if there are specific classes for which it excels. By thoroughly assessing the performance of our final model, we can ensure its effectiveness in meeting the objectives of the Car Evaluation project.
